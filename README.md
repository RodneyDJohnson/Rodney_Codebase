# Rodney_Codebase

This repository contains Rodney Johnson’s structured development environment for data automation, logistics analytics, and teaching support tools. The codebase is designed to support two primary domains:

1. **MedTrans & General Logistics LLC**

   - KPI automation
   - CSV and spreadsheet processing
   - Delivery-route analytics
   - Weekly and daily reporting tools

2. **United Truth Ministry**
   - Scripture parsing utilities
   - Teaching and lesson generators
   - Study data processing
   - Future dashboard integrations for insights
