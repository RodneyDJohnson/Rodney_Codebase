# Project Status Report

**Repository:** Rodney_Codebase  
**Maintainer:** Rodney D. Johnson  
**Purpose:** Unified development environment for MedTrans automation and UTM teaching tools.

---

## 1. Environment Setup (Completed)

### ✔ Folder Structure Established

A professional development directory was created under:

Structured into functional domains:

- **medtrans_automation/**
- **utm_teachings/**
- **dashboards/**
- **cloud_deploy/**
- **analytics/**
- **README.md**

This establishes a scalable backend framework for logistics automation and ministry study tools.

---

## 2. Python Execution Environment (Completed)

### ✔ Xcode License Acceptance

macOS required acceptance of Xcode Command Line Tools license.  
This was completed using:

Python is now fully enabled for scripting and execution.

---

## 3. Initial Script Development (Completed)

### ✔ Created `first_project_template.py`

Location: Lancaster, Ohio

medtrans_automation/scripts/

Capabilities implemented:

- Reads CSV delivery log
- Counts rows & displays column names
- Computes on-time vs late delivery counts
- Calculates per-route totals and average miles
- Identifies route with highest volume
- Provides operational insights for MedTrans logistics

A sample dataset (`sample.csv`) was added for validation.

---

## 4. Git Repository Initialization (Completed)

Actions taken:

- Initialized Git via `git init`
- Staged and committed initial files
- Renamed default branch to `main`
- Added and configured a `.gitignore` for Python projects
- Pushed repository to GitHub:

github.com/RodneyDJohnson/Rodney_Codebase

Result:  
A structured, public, version-controlled codebase with professional commits.

---

## 5. Enhancements & Commit Discipline (Ongoing)

Recent enhancements:

- Added total miles calculation
- Added per-route late delivery rate
- Cleaned folder/file naming
- Pushed updates with professional commit messages

Next enhancements:

- Export analytics to CSV/JSON
- Implement date-based filtering
- Expand MedTrans analytics toolbox
- Begin UTM scripture tagging utilities

---

## 6. Planned Development Path (Active)

### Current Sprint (Week 1–2):

- Strengthen Python fundamentals
- Expand analytics script
- Begin UTM tool (verse tagging + theme extraction)
- Maintain Git commit discipline

### Upcoming Weeks:

- Introduce Pandas-based analytics
- Add dashboards (React/JS where needed)
- Automate report generation
- Prepare cloud deployment strategies (AWS Lambda/S3/EC2)
- Integrate AI-assisted teaching utilities

---

## 7. Summary

The project is fully operational:

- Development environment stable
- GitHub repository active
- Automation scripts functional
- Documentation habits established
- Roadmap aligned with MedTrans operations and UTM ministry vision

This document will evolve as features are implemented and milestones are reached.
